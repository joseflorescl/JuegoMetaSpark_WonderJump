  - Note: Open your mouth to jump.
  - 6 enemies, each with its own animation.
  - In the Game Over state, the player's face will be shown distorted (Face Distortion), and a Pitch effect is applied to the microphone (a story must be recorded to see the effect).
  - All the logic was created using nodes (patches), without any code in scripts.
